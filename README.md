# Clustering and classification approaches to support transcriptomic analysis of microglial activation in human Alzheimer’s Disease

This repository contains all the scripts used in "Clustering and classification approaches to support transcriptomic analysis of microglial activation in human Alzheimer’s Disease", a research project as part of the Msc Health Data Analytics & Machine learning at Imperial College London.

This project forms part of the UKDRI Multi-’omics Atlas Project (MAP), an initiative to characterize the cellular pathology in Alzheimer's disease in a comprehensive manner.

In this study, we aim to define microglia transcriptome changes in AD using snRNAseq data. Can we robustly identify DAM in humans? We bring forward an optimized study
design and scRNAseq analytical workflow consisting of three parallel approaches

(1) direct clustering 

(2) guided clustering

(3) classification

The first approach replicates a typical scRNAseq workflow, yet is optimized for subtypes analysis of large datasets.
The second one leverages knowledge from mouse studies in an original way.

The last one showcases a nascent machine learning framework tailored to single cell transcriptomics.
